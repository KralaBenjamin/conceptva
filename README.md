# Concept - VA visualisation App


The application was created in the lecture " Visual Analytics f√ºr raum-zeitliche Daten  " (Visual Analytics for spatial-temporal data) in the winter term 21 / 22. In the beginning
measuring points have been visualised on a map, representing the salinity on the plane. With various tools, users can then set the threshold so that a separation into fresh and salt water can be made.
