# Concept - VA visualisation App


The application was created in the lecture " Visual Analytics f√ºr raum-zeitliche Daten  " (Visual Analytics for spatial-temporal data) in the winter term 21 / 22. In the beginning
measuring points have been visualised on a map, representing the salinity on the plane. With various tools, users can then set the threshold so that a separation into fresh and salt water can be made.
In addition the right side shows different properties of water below and above the threshold.

## Setup


To download the necessary data execute 
`database_builder.py`
This takes a lot of time and no breaks are possible.
Data is stored in `data_test.db`.

Then execute 
`Application.py`
to start the Application.
